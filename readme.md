### 1. Password Validation Failure in User Fixtures (https://github.com/Sathvik2199/hw10/issues/1)

**Issue:** Password validation rules were not correctly enforced or tested, causing failures in test cases like `test_register_user_with_valid_data' and 'test_update_user_with_valid_data'.

**Resolution:**
- Updated test passwords to comply with all validation rules (minimum 8 characters, including at least one digit, one uppercase letter, and one special character).
- Synced the password validation logic in user_schemas.py with business requirements.
- Added tests to confirm that weak or invalid passwords are rejected appropriately.



---

### 2. Implemented User ID Validation Using UUID (https://github.com/Sathvik2199/hw10/issues/5)

**Issue:** Tests were failing because the UserResponse schema expected the id field to be in UUID format, but the test fixtures did not provide UUIDs.

**Resolution:**
- Modified the conftest.py fixture to include UUID values for the id field.
- Verified that all related tests follow the updated schema rules for UUID-based IDs.

### 3. Fixture Failed SMTP Connection (https://github.com/Sathvik2199/hw10/issues/3)

**Issue:** Email-related tests did not pass because the SMTP settings were incorrectly configured in the testing setup.

**Resolution:**
- Set up Mailtrap credentials appropriately in the test environment.
- Validated the SMTP connection to ensure that all email functionality works as expected during testing.

---

### 4. Implemented Email Validation (https://github.com/Sathvik2199/hw10/issues/2)

**Issue:** The email fields lacked strict validation, allowing incorrect formats to pass undetected.

**Resolution:**
- Introduced regex-based validation to enforce correct email formatting.
- Developed thorough test cases to cover various valid and invalid email scenarios, including edge cases.

---

### 5. Cleaned Up User-Related Files (https://github.com/Sathvik2199/hw10/issues/4)

**Issue:** Several user-related files included redundant code such as unused variables, duplicate imports, and repeated fields.

**Resolution:**
- Removed unnecessary variables and cleaned up imports for improved readability.
- Resolved repeated field definitions in the userListResponse schema.
- Renamed duplicate test cases to prevent clashes and simplify maintenance.
- Enhanced error handling logic to better support unexpected or edge-case inputs.

## Key Learnings


- **Testing Discipline:** Regular testing after every change helped identify and resolve issues early, ensuring a stable and reliable codebase. Expanding test coverage improved robustness across edge cases.

- **Code Quality Tools:** Linters and automated checks ensured adherence to coding standards, enhanced overall code quality, and minimized technical debt.

- **Dependency Management:** Periodic updates and audits of dependencies like Gunicorn maintained security, compatibility, and system stability.

- **Version Control and Collaboration:** GitHub streamlined collaborative development through organized code reviews and clear commit histories.

- **CI/CD Pipeline Resilience:** Automating tests and Docker builds in the CI/CD process guaranteed that only verified code reached deployment, reducing runtime failures.

- **Environment-Specific Configurations:** Proper handling of development, test, and production settings ensured consistent application behavior and minimized config-based bugs.

- **Regex and Validation Expertise:** Regular expression-based validations reinforced data correctness and security by preventing improper inputs.

- **Error Logging and Monitoring:** Enhanced logging mechanisms enabled faster issue detection and debugging, improving production reliability.

- **Scalability Preparation:** Docker optimization and forward-thinking design for user features ensured readiness for growth and higher loads.

- **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing:** Thorough documentation of processes, changes, and fixes facilitated smooth onboarding and team collaboration.
